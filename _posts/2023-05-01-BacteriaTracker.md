# About 

This project takes place in the context of a collaboration with the microbiologists with whom we are intending to develop a pipeline to detect and track bacteria attaching themselves on a glass substrate. In this experimental setup, a flow of water loaded with bio-luminescent bacteria is passing a glass substrate while being imaged with a microscope at 0.5Hz. Some bacteria attach to the surface, sometimes detaching after some time. The objective of the project is to build a detector and tracker to follow these events and provide statistics on the adherence properties of the bacteria in various conditions, as a function of their angles with respect to the flow in particular.
